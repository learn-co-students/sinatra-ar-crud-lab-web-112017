<!-- The Delete CRUD action corresponds to the delete controller action, delete '/posts/:id/delete'. To initiate this action, we'll just add a "delete button" to the show page. This "button" will actually be a form, disguised as a button (intriguing, I know). The form will send a POST request to the delete controller action, where we will identify the post to delete and delete it. Then, the action should render a delete.erb view which confirms that the post has been deleted. -->
